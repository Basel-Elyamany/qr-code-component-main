## Overview
- This is my first project with Frontend Mentor. I had a few problems with it, but in the end, I'm kinda satisfied with the result. I hope you like it too. I used flexbox to align the component and media query for the responsiveness, and did learn a few tricks in the process.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use 2 new tricks, and they are clamp and media query, shown below

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
font-size: clamp(13px,1.5vw,20px)
@media (max-width: 375px){}
}
```
Thank you for the challenge, and I hope you can give me feedback about the code and how I could write it in a better way.
